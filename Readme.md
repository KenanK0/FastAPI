# 🚀 FastAPI Learning Playground

## What is this?
This repository exists because I decided to learn FastAPI  
And the best way to learn is to actually build something  
And then stare at it wondering why it does not work  
Until it does  

This is not a startup  
Not a SaaS  
Not the next unicorn  

It is just me learning FastAPI and friends, one endpoint at a time.

## Tech Stack aka Stuff I’m Learning
- Python
- FastAPI
- SQL
- Pydantic
- Pytest
- GitHub Actions
- CI/CD pipelines
- Debugging skills and emotional resilience

---

## What I’m Practicing Here
- API design that makes sense
- Routes, schemas, validation, models
- Talking to databases without upsetting them
- Writing tests so future me does not cry
- Automating things so computers judge me instead of humans

## Source
This project follows along with a very comprehensive FastAPI course:

**Learn Python API development in one of the most comprehensive courses ever on the topic**

YouTube link:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=2081s

It covers:
- Building a full FastAPI backend
- API design fundamentals
- SQL integration
- Testing with pytest
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions

In other words  
Someone explains things very well  
I pause the video  
I try it myself  
This repo is the result
